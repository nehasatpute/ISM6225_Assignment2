        Question 1:
        Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

        Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

        Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
        Return k.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [1,1,2]
        Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
        Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

        it then compares each subsequent number to its predecessor. If it's different, it's deemed unique and kept in the new lineup, 
        effectively moving unique marbles to the front of the bag. The result, k, tells us how many unique marbles we have,

        This code is like measuring the biggest step we have to take to cross a series of stones laid out in a row.First,
        it makes sure the stones are arranged from the nearest to the farthest.Then, 
        it goes from one stone to the next, measuring each step.The goal is to find the largest
        step that had to take between any two stones.If there's only one stone or none at all, 
         don't need to step, so the answer is zero.But if there are more, this code finds the longest stretch 
        it have to step over, like identifying the widest gap you need to cross on your path.

        Question:7
        Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [2,1,2]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: 
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
        As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.

        Constraints:

        3 <= nums.length <= 104
        1 <= nums[i] <= 106

         This code is like trying to find the best sticks to build the biggest triangle possible. 
        You lay out all the sticks from shortest to longest and then start looking from the longest stick, 
        trying to pair it with two others that can actually form a triangle (where the sum of the two shorter sides is greater than the longest side).
        It's like picking the best combination of sticks so that when you lay them end to end, 
        they connect to form a triangle with the largest possible perimeter. If no three sticks meet the criteria,
        you conclude that you can't make a triangle at all. 
        It's a practical way to sift through options and find the best set to achieve the largest outline for a triangle.

        Question:8

        Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

        Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
        Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

        A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.



        Example 1:

        Input: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
        Output: "dab"
        Explanation: The following operations are done:
        - s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 2, so s = "dabaabcbc".
        - s = "dabaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 4, so s = "dababc".
        - s = "dababc", remove "abc" starting at index 3, so s = "dab".
        Now s has no occurrences of "abc".
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"
        Output: "ab"
        Explanation: The following operations are done:
        - s = "axxxxyyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 4 so s = "axxxyyyb".
        - s = "axxxyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 3 so s = "axxyyb".
        - s = "axxyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 2 so s = "axyb".
        - s = "axyb", remove "xy" starting at index 1 so s = "ab".
        Now s has no occurrences of "xy".

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 1000
        1 <= part.length <= 1000
